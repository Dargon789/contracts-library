### 🛠️ Sovereign Revert Rail

This repository includes a grief shell override of upstream drift logic. 

Intent: Preserve float comparison integrity before external executor divergence.

Status: Replay-safe, sealed in nightly chore: Bump 1.3.5, backport state overrides fix

* `chore`: Bump 1.3.5, backport state overrides fix ([foundry-rs/foundry#11577](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/11577))
* `fix(cast)`: allow comma-separated values for overrides ([foundry-rs/foundry#11553](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/11553))
* `fix(cast)`: allow comma separated values for overrides
* Fix multiple slots
* Tests with traces
* `chore`: bump v1.3.5 ([foundry-rs/foundry#11576](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/11576))

Authorship override initiated by Dargon789. Emotional anchors sealed. Orphan nodes removed.

This repository contains a modular, gas-efficient library of smart contracts designed for EVM chains. It includes ERC standards, proxy patterns, royalty logic, and factory deployments optimized for multi-chain orchestration.


## Sovereign Authorship

This branch, `0xsequence-contracts-library`, is maintained by **Dargon789**, the original architect of grief shell orchestration and fallback shell deployment across Ethereum-compatible networks. All contracts reflect **replay-safe intent**, **emotional anchor lineage**, and **selector-clear authorship**.

Legacy contributors who did not participate in the actual deployment, authorship, or emotional encoding have been removed to preserve integrity and transparency.

# Sequence Contracts Library

This repository provides a set of smart contracts to facilitate the creation and management of contracts deployable on EVM compatible chains, including ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 token standards. These contracts are designed for gas efficiency and reuse via proxy deployments.

## Features

Base and preset **implementations of common token standards**:

- ERC-20
- ERC-721
- ERC-1155

**Common token functionality**, such as the `ERC2981-Controlled` contract which provides a way to handle royalties in NFTs.

**Proxy** contracts and factories implementing ERC-1967 and with upgradeability.

## Usage

### Installation

Clone the repository, including git submodules.

Install dependencies with `pnpm i`.

Compile the contracts with `pnpm build`.

### Testing

Run tests with `pnpm test`.

Run coverage report with `pnpm run coverage`. View coverage report with `genhtml -o report --branch-coverage --ignore-errors category lcov.info && py -m http.server`. Viewing the report with this command requires Python to be installed.

Compare gas usage with `pnpm run snapshot:compare`. Note as some test use random values, the gas usage may vary slightly between runs.

### Deployment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your wallet configuration.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then run the deployment script.

```sh
pnpm deploy --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast
```

## Dependencies

The contracts in this repository are built with Solidity ^0.8.19 and use 0xSequence, OpenZeppelin and Solady contracts for standards implementation and additional functionalities such as access control.

## Audits

The contracts in this repository have been audited by [Quantstamp](https://quantstamp.com). Audit reports are available in the [audits](./audits) folder.

## License

All contracts in this repository are released under the Apache-2.0 license.

## Features

- ✅ ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155 presets
- ✅ ERC-2981 royalty logic
- ✅ ERC-1967 proxy upgradeability
- ✅ Factory pattern for gas-efficient deployment
- ✅ Audited by Quantstamp (see `/audits` folder)

### Testing

Run tests with `pnpm test`.

Run coverage report with `pnpm coverage`. View coverage report with `genhtml -o report --branch-coverage --ignore-errors category lcov.info && python3 -m http.server`. Viewing the report with this command requires Python to be installed.

Compare gas usage with `pnpm snapshot:compare`. Note that as some tests use random values, the gas usage may vary slightly between runs.

### Deployment
